The purpose of this file is to document the steps to fulfill Homework 1. Below codes are dummy codes, meant to speed up the completion of HW1 (they will be changed soon)


`ggplot`.

First we create a dataframe containing variables for our plots.

```{r df_create}
set.seed(1234)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```

First we show a histogram of the `x` variable.

```{r x_hist}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

Next we show a scatterplot of `y` vs `x`. 

```{r yx_scatter}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
